# Traefik with Let's Encrypt
Traefik is a nice little product that makes it easy to deploy a reverse proxy for Docker containers. This document describes how to set up
a Digital Ocean node, install Docker on it, run Traefik, and configure it to use Let's Encrypt for wildcard certificates.

## Digital Ocean node

## Installing Docker on node

## Run Traefik
Now that we have Docker running on the node, we need to run Traefik. This is probably the simplest step of all. But since we're running on the Internet, we can't just fire up Traefik - you'd want to protect at least the monitoring port.

### Prepare for Traefik setup
We'll assume that all apps will be located under the `${USERDIR}/docker/` in their own folder.

#### Create username and password for HTTP authentication
To protect the Traefik monitoring UI, we'll use HTTP authentication.
1. Create a file `.htpasswd` in `${USERDIR}/docker/shared`
2. Create a strong username/password combo. You can use [HTPASSWD Generator](http://www.htaccesstools.com/htpasswd-generator/), or LastPass, or similar
3. Add the combo to `.htpasswd` as follows:

    `username:password`
    
    where `username` is your chosen username, and `password` is the strong password generated by your utility of choice.
4. Save the file and exit

#### Update environmental variables
    TZ="America/New_York"
    USERDIR="/home/USER"
    HTTP_USERNAME=username
    HTTP_PASSWORD=password
    DOMAINNAME=example.com

1. `TZ` is the timezone for your machine. Find your correct timezone in [the timezone database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones)
2. `USERDIR` is the path to the homefolder of the current user. Replace `USER` with your user ID.
3. `username` is the username you created for the HTTP authentication
4. `password` is the strong password you created for the HTTP authentication

#### Prepare the Traefik folders and files
Create folders for Traefik and ACME. With the `${USERDIR}` environment variable set as above, run the following commands:
    mkdir ${USERDIR}/docker/traefik
    mkdir ${USERDIR}/docker/traefik/acme

Create an empty acme.json file for Traefik to use:
    touch ${USERDIR}/docker/traefik/acme/acme.json
    chmod 500 ${USERDIR}/docker/traefik/acme/acme.json

## Configure Traefik to use Let's Encrypt
We'll set up Traefik to use subdomains for the different apps that we want to run. Create `${USERDIR}/docker/traefik/traefik.toml` with the following content:

    #debug = true

    logLevel = "ERROR" #DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL, PANIC
    # InsecureSkipVerify = true 
    defaultEntryPoints = ["https", "http"]

    # WEB interface of Traefik - it will show web page with overview of frontend and backend configurations 
    [web]
    address = ":8080"
      [web.auth.basic]
      usersFile = "/shared/.htpasswd"

    # Force HTTPS
    [entryPoints]
      [entryPoints.http]
      address = ":80"
        [entryPoints.http.redirect]
        entryPoint = "https"
      [entryPoints.https]
      address = ":443"
        [entryPoints.https.tls]

    [file]
      watch = true
      filename = "/etc/traefik/rules.toml"

    # Let's encrypt configuration
    [acme]
    email = "email@domain.com" #any email id will work
    storage="/etc/traefik/acme/acme.json"
    entryPoint = "https"
    acmeLogging=true 
    onDemand = false #create certificate when container is created
    [[acme.domains]]
       main = "EXAMPLE.COM"
    [[acme.domains]]
       main = "*.EXAMPLE.COM"
   
    # Connection to docker host system (docker.sock)
    [docker]
    endpoint = "unix:///var/run/docker.sock"
    domain = "EXAMPLE.COM"
    watch = true
    # This will hide all docker containers that don't have explicitly  
    # set label to "enable"
    exposedbydefault = false

Replace the following:
1. `email@domain.com` with your email address
2. `EXAMPLE.COM` with your domain name
3. You may have to enable the InsecureSkipVerify line to allow some apps access through Traefik
4. `exposedbydefault = false` forces you to use `traefik.enable=true` in docker compose to put apps behind traefik. If you would like to do this for all apps, change it to exposedbydefault to true.
